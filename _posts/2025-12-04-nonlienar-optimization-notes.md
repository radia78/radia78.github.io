A bad habit of mine is stuffing all my knowledge on a scrap paper only to completely forget them after an exam. So in the interests of retaining knowledge, I've decided to make a "write-up" for my classes and create digital notes for my own (and perhaps others') use.

Here are my notes on Comp Sci 726 at UW-Madison, which is a graduate level course on non-linear optimization.

## Notes
1. [Preliminaries](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bzIRip-ny6ujTU46Nl9syp8hW1gcmQot)
2. [Basic Descent Analysis]()
3. [Nonsmooth Descent Analysis]()
4. [Projected Gradient Descent]()
5. [Stochastic Gradient Descent]()
7. [2nd Order Methods and Acceleration]()
