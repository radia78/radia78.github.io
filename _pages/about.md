I'm a second-year Master's student studying Data Science at UW-Madison. I'm interested in machine learning in particular anything to do with modern science of deep learning and efficient machine learning (data/compute-wise). On my free time I like to overthink about stuff, general outdoor stuff, and exercise. I like to play (and never finish) a game of civilization.
